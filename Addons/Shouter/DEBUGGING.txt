DEBUGGING SHOUTER ADDON
======================

If the addon doesn't appear in your addon list:

1. CHECK INSTALLATION PATH
   Make sure the addon is installed in the correct location:
   - The folder must be named exactly "Shouter" (case sensitive)
   - Path should be: WoW/_classic_/Interface/AddOns/Shouter/
   - Inside should be Shouter.toc and Shouter.lua

2. INTERFACE VERSION
   Current .toc uses Interface: 11503 (Classic Era 1.15.3)
   
   Other versions to try:
   - Classic Era: 11502, 11503, 11504
   - Classic Wrath: 30403
   - Classic Cataclysm: 40400
   
   To check your version, type in-game:
   /script print(GetBuildInfo())

3. FILE ENCODING
   The .toc file must be saved as:
   - Plain text (not RTF or Word)
   - UTF-8 without BOM
   - Windows line endings (CRLF) preferred

4. COMMON ISSUES
   - Addon folder inside another folder (e.g., Shouter/Shouter/)
   - .toc file has wrong name (must match folder name)
   - Hidden file extensions (.toc.txt instead of .toc)
   - Missing or extra spaces in .toc headers

5. TEST IF ADDON LOADS
   Type this in-game:
   /script print(IsAddOnLoaded("Shouter"))
   
   If it prints "true", the addon loaded but may have errors.
   If "false" or "nil", check installation.

6. CHECK FOR ERRORS
   Enable Lua errors:
   /console scriptErrors 1
   
   Then reload:
   /reload
